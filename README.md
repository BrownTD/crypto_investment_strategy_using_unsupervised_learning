## Crypto_investment_strategy_using_unsupervised_learning

In this Challenge, I assumed the role of an advisor in one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Competitors are fierce, so I want to propose a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies. Instead of basing my proposal on only returns and volatility, I wanted to include other factors that might impact the crypto marketâ€”leading to better performance for my portfolio.

## Installation Guide

In this Challenge, I combined my financial Python programming skills with unsupervised learning clustering techniques. I created a Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods. I then plotted the results so that I can visually show the performance of each cryptocurrency.
